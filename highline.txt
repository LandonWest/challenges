HighLine was designed to ease the tedious tasks of doing console input and output
    with low-level methods like gets() and puts().
HighLine provides a robust system for requesting data from a user, without needing
    to code all the error checking and validation rules and without needing to convert
    the typed Strings into what your program really needs. Just tell HighLine what
    youâ€˜re after, and let it do all the work.




from your working directory, in the terminal type:

gem install highline


Ex. 1 - Asks a user for a zip code, automatically does validation, and returns the result:
          zip = ask("Zip?  ") { |q| q.validate = /\A\d{5}(?:-?\d{4})?\Z/ }

Ex. 2 - Type conversion for answers:

        ask("Birthday?  ", Date)
        ask("Interests?  (comma sep list)  ", lambda { |str| str.split(/,\s*/) })

Ex. 3 - Reading passwords:

        ask("Enter your password:  ") { |q| q.echo = false }
        ask("Enter your password:  ") { |q| q.echo = "x" }
